This is Bennett Kanuka's personal blog. I work for Lixar I.T. in Ottawa, Canada but any opinions or things I might write are strictly my own.

At Lixar, I helped grow the data science group from 3 employees to over 20 data scientists, engineers, and visualization experts. I have worked in almost every sub-field of machine learning and AI.

Sometimes I write about Linux, scripting languages, and other things I find interesting.
