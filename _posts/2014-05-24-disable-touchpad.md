First of all, I'd like to get a naming convention out of the way.
Being that this is a public blog, I will be using the term "TrackPoint" to refer to the mouse in the middle of the keyboard.
The following XKCD offers other possible naming conventions:

Maybe it's me, or maybe the configuration of my laptop (I'm actually on a Dell right now, not a Thinkpad) but whenever I use the Trackpoint mouse, I tend to tap the touchpad and make erronious clicks.
In the past I've simply disabled the touchpad, which works for me, but tends to annoy anyone else who uses my laptop - even breifly.
Plus, more than anything, I liked the challenge.

All of the solutions I found of Google were inadequate for one reason or another, so I decided to craft my own.
